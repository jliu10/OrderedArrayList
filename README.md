# OrderedArrayList
- Discussed how to call old add method when an IllegalArgumentException is thrown, which we resolved by either preceding with "super."" or preceding with the name of the superclass.
- Discussed what NoNullArrayList constructor would look like, concluded that it could just call the super constructor.

- Added class NoNullArrayList<T> and wrote constructors
